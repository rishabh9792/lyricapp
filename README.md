This application is built using the [lyrics.ovh API](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#).

Just enter the name of the song that you want to hear in the search box. You will get a list of related songs with the appropriate artist cover, title, artist name, a preview and a button to get the lyrics.

The page also provides pagination to browse within an entire range of songs for a particular search.
